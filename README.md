# Speech-Emotion-Recognition

##Problem Statement 

Speech is the most natural way of expressing ourselves as humans. It is only natural then to extend this communication medium to computer applications.
We define speech emotion recognition (SER) systems as a collection of methodologies that process and classify speech signals to detect the embedded emotions. 

  a. We will use CREMA dataset that is available at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/dmitrybabko/speech-emotion-recognition-en  

  b. Write your own function that loads an audio and listen to each of the classes you have and plot the waveform of the audio.
